# GSOC-22-Video-Swin-Transformers

This summer I participated in [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) as a contributor, and my mentors were   [Luiz GUStavo Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiz-gustavo-martins-64ab5891/) and  [Sayak Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayak-paul/).

This repository presents `TensorFlow 2` implementations of the [Video Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13230) models, code for convertion of `PyTorch` weights to `TensorFlow 2` models and notebook for fine-tuning the models on `UCF101` dataset.

You can find the final report of the project [here](https://github.com/shoaib6174/GSOC-22-Video-Swin-Transformers/blob/main/assets/final_report.md).
